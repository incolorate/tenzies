### Tenzies
 
A simple dice game built with:
* React 
* CSS
* HTML

This project was included in the Scrimba React curriculum:
* A timer starts as soon as you begin to roll the dice.
* The timer monitors how much time it takes you to win the game.
* When a player wins the game, a winning animation plays using React confetti.
